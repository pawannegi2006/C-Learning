🧠 C++ Learning Projects

Welcome to my C++ Learning Repository!
This repo is a collection of small, hands-on mini projects I’m building while learning and improving my C++ skills. Each project focuses on applying core programming concepts in a fun and practical way — from basic syntax and logic to slightly more complex problem-solving.

🧩 What You’ll Find Here

Each folder contains a different mini project with:

📄 Source code (.cpp file)

💡 Short description of what the program does

🧠 Concepts practiced (loops, conditionals, functions, etc.)

⚙️ Example Project

Force Calculator
A simple physics-based calculator that computes:

Fundamental Force (F = m × a)

Gravitational Force (W = m × g)

Frictional Force (F = μ × N)

This project helped me practice user input/output, mathematical operations, and clean console formatting.

🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as a personal learning log — a place where I experiment, make mistakes, learn from them, and grow as a C++ programmer.

🧰 Tech Used- VS CODE

Language: C++

IDE: Visual Studio Code / any C++ compiler
