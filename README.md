Force Calculator (C++ Learning Project)

This is a simple C++ mini project I created while learning programming fundamentals. It’s a Force Calculator that helps compute three basic types of forces commonly studied in physics:

Fundamental Force (Newton’s Second Law): 
𝐹
=
𝑚
×
𝑎
F=m×a

Gravitational Force (Weight): 
𝑊
=
𝑚
×
𝑔
W=m×g

Frictional Force: 
𝐹
=
𝜇
×
𝑁
F=μ×N

The program takes user inputs such as mass, acceleration, coefficient of friction, and normal force, then calculates and displays the results neatly.

It’s a small but meaningful project that helped me practice C++ basics like input/output, condition handling, and formula-based computation — a fun step in my learning journey! 🚀
